# tinder_location_changer
A small bot with selenium that logs to tinder in the selected location.

How to use:

1. After installing all requirements, just execute main.py file and a GUI interface will show.
2. Search the city you would like to swipe in in Google Maps and copy and paste its latitude and longitude.
3. Enter the name of the city and click "Add Location". This will save the location in a sqlite3 database and you will be able to access that location anytime after.
4. Then just enter the name of the place you just saved in the database in "Selected location" and click launch.

(If it is the first time you launch de bot, tinder will ask you to log in. Once you do that the first time, user data will be saved and it will not ask to log in again.)

Safe travels!
